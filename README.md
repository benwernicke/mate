# Devel

- Use the provided abstraction
- Don't overcomplicate thinks
- Every Sub project in its own file with an apropriate header
- Comments must be started with Name (3 letters identifiable) and date dd.mm.yy
- constructors (stuff which allocates and initlizes) postfix \_cons
- setter postfix \_set
- getter no postfix required
- function which return bool have is_ prefix after 'namespace'

## Solve

## Differentiate

## Integrate

## Simplefy

## AST

The DS we will build on is an AST which will be handled dynamicly by relative pointers
- no function returns pointers or receives pointers of nodes -> rptr
