# Development
- Use the provided abstraction
- Don't overcomplicate things
- Every Sub project in its own file with an appropriate header
- Comments must be started with Name (3 letters identifiable) and date dd.mm.yy
- constructors (stuff which allocates and initliaizes) postfix \_cons
- setter postfix \_set
- getter no postfix required
- function which return boolean have is_ prefix after 'namespace'


## Solve

## Differentiate

## Integrate

## AST

### TODO
- better input validation / input validation at all

The DS we will build on is an AST which will be handled dynamicly by relative pointers
- no function returns pointers or receives pointers of nodes -> rptr
